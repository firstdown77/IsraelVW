                  This application shows how much water Israel imports and 
                  exports from other countries using an animated map.
              </p>
              <p>
                  On the map, the bigger the dot is on a country, the 
                  more virtual water that country is exporting.  A table 
                  appears below the map to demonstrate how the map's 
                  data is calculated.  The standard unit of measurement 
                  for virtual water trade is million cubic meters (mcm).
              </p>
              <p>
                  The application also demonstrates the effects of third party 
                  intermediaries on Israel’s virtual water trade. For example 
                  in 2012, Israel imported 675,452,356 cubic meters of green 
                  virtual water from Switzerland. However, Switzerland does not itself produce
                  large amounts of wheat for export; third party import / export 
                  firms located in Switzerland act as intermediaries in Israel’s 
                  global wheat trade. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Virtual water trade is the hidden flow of water when food or other commodities
                  are traded from one place to another. For instance, it takes 1,600 cubic
                  meters of water on average to produce one metric tonne of wheat.  When
                  a country like Israel imports a tonne of wheat, it indirectly imports 1,600
                  cubic meters of water on average.  The precise volume of water can
                  be more or less depending on climatic conditions and agricultural practice
                  in the origin country.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Israel is a country stressed for water.  This mostly-arid country
                  has the fourth highest population density in the world.  Its major
                  water sources are under demand by Israelis and Palestinians.
                  Israel imports virtual water from other countries to help balance its water needs.
              </p>

                  Israel's Virtual Water Trade Map was developed by Raphael Astrow, a student
                  in Carnegie Mellon University's Information Systems Program, under direction
                  of Dr. Randy Weinberg, Program Director.
